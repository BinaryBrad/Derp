# Derp
A repository for a game I'm working on with my friends in Unity. If you would like to help please let me know!
So basically, we are trying to make a simple platformer in which the player is a (maybe) cute little guy, that always 
has a derpy expressions and makes derpy sounds when he stomps on enemies. Not reall sure what a derpy sound is though...
